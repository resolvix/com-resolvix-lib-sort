# com-resolvix-lib-sort

A Java library of sorting algorithms

## Algorithms supported

### Bubble sort

Provides a basic implementation of the uni-directional bubble sort, or sorting
by exchange, algorithm. Both the worst-case and best-case performance of the
algorithm is O(n<sup>2</sup>).

The bubble sort algorithm is more particularly described in the paper: 
[Bubble Sort: An Archealogical Algorithmic Analysis](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/bubble/bubble.pdf).

### Shellsort

Provides a basic implementation of the Shellsort, a development of the bubble
sort and insertion sort algorithms. The worst-case and best-case performance
of the algorithm are O(n<sup>2</sup>) and O(n log<sup>2</sup> n) respectively.

The Shellsort algorithm is more particularly described in the paper:
[A high-speed sorting procedure](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/368370.368387).
