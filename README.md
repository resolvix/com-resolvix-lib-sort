### Bubble sort

Provides a basic implementation of the uni-directional bubble sort algorithm.
Sorting of the target array or list terminates when the array or list is
finally sorted.

The bubble sort algorithm is more particularly described in the paper 
[Bubble Sort: An Archealogical Algorithmic Analysis](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/bubble/bubble.pdf).
